This is a really simple program aimed to show the search progress executed by the A star algorithm. It's fully written in Python with Pygame. The purpose of the program is to show A star working for peoples who wants to figure out how it works.
There is actually no interface and all the options are managed from the command line. You can set the size of the nodes and the speed of the animation (use --help for more about the available commands).
The controls are : p + click to place the player (starting node), t + click to place the target node (node to reach) and w to place walls. You can also use s to save your graphs into a plain text file for further modifications or whatever.
